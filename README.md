**ART (Advanced RAG Techniques)** is an open-source library aimed at simplifying and enhancing the implementation of advanced techniques for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). The project is focused on helping developers and researchers boost the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) in both text-based and multimodal (text and vision) applications.

## **Purpose of the Project**

RAG is a powerful method used in AI systems to augment models with retrieval mechanisms, making them more effective at answering complex questions by referring to external data sources. However, implementing advanced techniques in RAG can be time-consuming and complex. ART aims to reduce this complexity by providing modular, easy-to-use techniques that enhance retrieval and generation processes.

Our goal is to create a collection of state-of-the-art methods that can be integrated into existing RAG pipelines, improving accuracy, efficiency, and the overall performance of AI models in real-world applications.

## **To-Do List**

The following tasks are planned for the development of ART:

- [ ] **Library Structure & Setup**: Finalize the directory structure and base files for easy installation and usage.
- [ ] **Context Enrichment**: Research and implement methods for enriching context in RAG, such as overlapping chunk context.
- [ ] **Hybrid Retrieval**: Develop and test a hybrid approach combining dense and sparse retrieval methods.
- [ ] **Integration with Open-Source LLMs**: Ensure seamless integration with open-source models (e.g., text-based and vision multimodal models).
- [ ] **Vector Database Compatibility**: Work on compatibility with vector databases like Elasticsearch, Pinecone, and others.

## **Project Vision**

- **Simplified RAG implementation**: Reduce the complexity involved in applying advanced RAG techniques to AI models.
- **Focus on Context**: Explore new methods to provide AI models with enhanced contextual understanding by leveraging advanced document segmentation and retrieval strategies.
- **Community-Centric**: Foster a community of developers and researchers to contribute ideas, code, and improvements to the library.
